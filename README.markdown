# DOLL SOFTWARE LICENSE :scroll: :black_nib:

***A simple open-source license that respects FOSS developers. :scroll: :black_nib:***

## ABOUT :books:

In my opinion, there is a lot wrong with the licensing schemes that exist for FOSS software. I made this license for the following reasons:

- A lot of companies use FOSS software, but neither credit nor compensate the developers of this FOSS software.
- This license still respects the basic principles of FOSS software but aggressively forbids companies or other parties from doing the following:
  - a) Using your FOSS project for commercial purposes without compensating you and/or crediting you.
  - b) Deriving something from your FOSS project and filing a patent without your consent or without compensating you.

## ABBREVIATIONS :gear:

Similar to how other licenses have abbreviations like "GPL v3", the Doll Software License has the abbreviation of `DSL v1` or `DSL-1`.

## LICENSE :scroll:

To include the license in your FOSS project, simply copy-paste the following text into your `LICENSE` file.
